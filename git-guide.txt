These commands only work when you are in the right folder - on Windows recommend using PowerShell that comes with GitHub Desktop:

git clone <URL to repository> = pull in a repository(download a project)

git status = show the difference between the local repository and the one on Git server
	untracked files = new file/new change

git add <file name> = track the new file/change
	use -A or ./ to add all files in current folder

git commit -m <"message"> = update the local repository with a message

git push = update the repository on Git server with the local repository


If you are already have a clone(copy):

git pull = update the current repository
